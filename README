Wes, A SIMPLE B-TREE FILE TOKENIZER

Copyright 2005-2013 Alejandro Ricoveri <alejandroricoveri@gmail.com>


WHAT IS WES ?

Wes is a tiny text file tokenizer written in C. 
It is the result of a small file tokenizer project I made 
in college and initially written in C++, it was called 'ws' (for Word Sort).
I finally decided to clean the code, port it to C and 
to release it as open source under the terms of the GPL.


WES OBJECTIVES

* To be minimalist
* To be clean
* To be well documented
* To be C99 compliant code
* To help students in basic connaisances


HOW TO BUILD WES ?

$ cc wes.c -o wes


WHAT WES DOES

Wes takes an input file and reads all tokens it can find, 
organizes them and saves each line ocurrence for
each token found in the input file.


EXAMPLE

-- roses.txt --
Roses are red, Violets are blue
All I can do is thinking of you ...
-- EOF --

$ ./wes roses.txt
-- roses.txt tokenizing statistics --

Below you'll see the list of tokens found,
followed by the line numbers where they were found
with their respective number of ocurrences in parenthesis

* All:  2(1)
* I:  2(1)
* Roses:  1(1)
* Violets:  1(1)
* are:  1(2)
* blue:  1(1)
* can:  2(1)
* do:  2(1)
* is:  2(1)
* of:  2(1)
* red:  1(1)
* thinking:  2(1)
* you:  2(1)

    13 token(s) found
     3 line(s) read

-- End of execution --
