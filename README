Wes is a text file tokenizer. 
It is the result of a small file tokenizer project I made 
for a course back in my college days (2005) 
who was named 'ws' (wordsorter).  
I finally decided to release it as open source under 
the terms of the GPL.

What Wes does
Wes takes a file and read all tokens it can find, 
organizes them and even 

Example:

-- roses.txt --
Roses are red, Violets are blue
All I can do is thinking of you ...
-- EOF --

Usage:
wes roses.txt

Output:
-- roses.txt tokenizing statistics --
Below you'll see the list of tokens found, followed by the line numbers where it was found, each one with their respective number of ocurrences in parenthesis

* All:  2(1)
* I:  2(1)
* Roses:  1(1)
* Violets:  1(1)
* are:  1(2)
* blue:  1(1)
* can:  2(1)
* do:  2(1)
* is:  2(1)
* of:  2(1)
* red:  1(1)
* thinking:  2(1)
* you:  2(1)

    13 token(s) found
     3 lines(s) read
-- End of execution --

Command Line Options:
--help	Print a help message and exit
--verbose run with debug info

Errors:
Wes can produce the following error messages to stderr

File not found.
Not enough memory for allocation.
