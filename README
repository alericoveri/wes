WHAT IS WES ?

Wes is a text file tokenizer. 
It is the result of a small file tokenizer project I made 
for a course back in my college days in 2005.
It was named 'ws' (wordsorter) back then.  
I finally decided to release it as open source under 
the terms of the GPL.

WHAT WES DOES

Wes takes an input file and reads all tokens it can find, 
organizes them and saves each line ocurrence for
each token found in the input file.

EXAMPLE

-- roses.txt --
Roses are red, Violets are blue
All I can do is thinking of you ...
-- EOF --

$ wes roses.txt
-- roses.txt tokenizing statistics --

Below you'll see the list of tokens found,
followed by the line numbers where they were found
with their respective number of ocurrences in parenthesis

* All:  2(1)
* I:  2(1)
* Roses:  1(1)
* Violets:  1(1)
* are:  1(2)
* blue:  1(1)
* can:  2(1)
* do:  2(1)
* is:  2(1)
* of:  2(1)
* red:  1(1)
* thinking:  2(1)
* you:  2(1)

    13 token(s) found
     3 line(s) read

-- End of execution --


COMMAND LINE OPTIONS

--help	Print a help message and exit
--verbose run with debug info

ERRORS

Wes can produce the following error messages to stderr

"File not found"
"Not enough memory for allocation"
